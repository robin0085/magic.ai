### Study Experience

It is about how to manage time for study.

It is not about how good at study you are.

While pursuit study for the program, it is the interests to learn the subjects that matters,
rather than show off the scores.

The point is to focus on study itself, and cultivate the interests as progressing the study.

Wisely enough, it is by means of time management to incorportate the study into the life.

To avoid distraction by the standard of study performance, the valuable study experience would not discourage you to acquire specific filed knowledge,
but enhance your confidence to discover and expand your interests, even your ambitions.
